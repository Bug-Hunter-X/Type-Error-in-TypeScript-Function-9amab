This bug demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript.  The `greeter` function is defined to accept a single string argument, but the code attempts to pass an array of strings. TypeScript's type system correctly identifies this mismatch and throws an error. The solution demonstrates how to correctly handle this by either iterating over the array or modifying the function signature.
